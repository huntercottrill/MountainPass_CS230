# MountainPass

MountainPass is a pre order self pick up service for on campus restaurants dedciated to the students at West Virginia University.

## Motivation

Throughout the brainstorming process there was a discovery that WVU does not have a pre order system for the on campus dining options. That being said the team decided to build our own application 
due to the fact that we felt it was not safe to stand in line longer than you have to for food due to COVID-19.
